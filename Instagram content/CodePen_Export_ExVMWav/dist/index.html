    <h2> Company profile is a must!</h2>
    <p> A company profile is a professional business description. It's very important to let people know a general idea about us before creating any posts. Details like  company name, established date, physical address per location, phone numbers, website URL, and email address should appear at the beginning of the business profile. It should always be accurate and up-to- date.</p>

    <h2> Instagram stories to build our audience</h2>
    <p> Instagram stories is a growing business opportunity. Every day, more than half a billion people consume Instagram stories. It's a huge market, and it's still rising. Stories will also drive traffic back to the feed so that you can beat the algorithm, or at least increase your interaction when you show up in Stories. They also have features like poll, question, countdown, quiz that can help us do surveys and interact with our audience.</p>

    <h2>Offering a list of benefits of our business</h2>
    <p> If a company doesn't benefit an individual, why would they bother to join, right? So listing how they can get benefits from our company is a good way to drive an audience. They should get an idea of how they can grow as a person and also increase their skills by joining our company. We should also be able to note why we are different from other companies. </p>

    <h2> Thought Bubble, a unique way to reach out!</h2>
    <p>Sharing some wisdom from others who have been in our company through a thought bubble. We can pair it with a photo and share it with a caption. This will reach out to people about how our employees feel and think about the company. When we all think or do the same thing, there would be no new thoughts or experience, so it’s a fun way to let people learn about us from their perspective.

    <p>People enjoy seeing inside what you're working on. People love to share their opinions, too. Sharing a few concepts for a recent project allows people to get a glimpse of your work, and inviting them to choose their favorite project gives them a reason to comment and engage with your post.

    <h2> Just a little sneak-peek! </h2>
    <p>Creating a project hype and anticipation will generate excitement for your company. Something as simple as a logo sketch or a screenshot of a new website or ideas for an ongoing project can leave people on pins and needles for final disclosure. Thus, they tend to come back or even do some research on us!

Sharing bits and pieces of the project and tracking down the progress of the project  in an Instagram post will make people interested to learn more about us. To create even more engagement, we can ask people which project or feature is their favorite and also let them share their ideas towards our projects.

    <p>Followers can get to know the faces behind the scenes through an Instagram post or a series of Instagram stories! Not only does this humanize our company, but it also forges more personal connections and helps followers to feel like they know us. It's a very nice way to appreciate the team and let the world know about them as well. It can help them network with more people and build their own connections. It’s a win-win!
